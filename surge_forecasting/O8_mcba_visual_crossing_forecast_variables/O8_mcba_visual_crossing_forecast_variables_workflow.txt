Contained herein are the processes for gathering VC forecast data, processing it to the model input format and conducting uncertainty quantification.

O8_1_visual_crossing_api_surge_variable_request.m
Downloads the visual crossing 24 hour forecasts at grid locations using Visual Crossing weather API 

O8_2_1_visual_crossing_grid_variable_sorter.m
Arranges the grid forecasts into array format

O8_2_2_visual_crossing_local_variable_sorter.m
Arranges the local forecasts into array format

O8_3_apply_pc_coefficients.m
Applies the principal component coefficients and feature statistics to the grid forecasts to convert them to the same principal component domain as the models

O8_4_1_calculate_pc_errors.m
Adjusts bias and calculates the mean and standard deviation of the principal component feature errors between VC and ERA5 data for the year 2020

O8_4_2_calculate_local_errors.m
Adjusts bias and calculates the mean and standard deviation of the local feature errors between VC and ERA5 data for the year 2020

O8_5_prepare_vc_mcba_designmatrix.m
Pulls the bias corrected principal components, local variables and surge residual timeseries from O8 and O4 and constructs a forecast design matrix
