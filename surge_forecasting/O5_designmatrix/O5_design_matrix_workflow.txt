Contained herein is the process for building and normalising the design matrix for surge forecast model training and ABMS testing

To reduce the size of the repository the design matrix for era5 data used for model training (1980 to 2019) has not been included, instead a reduced design matrix is provided here. 
The full design matrix can be provided upon request.

O5_1_build_design_matrix.m
Pulls the principal component, local variables and surge residual timeseries from O3 and O4 and constructs 3D normalised design matrix with dimensions [observations, time, features] with normalising feature statistics
