Contained herein are the processes for selecting the location and lag time of model inputs.
This is done using the following scripts

.m
A script to draw a 1000 km fetch boundary from the north and south boundary to the Irish Sea and 

.m 
A script to determine the lagtime of maximal correlation ebtween the Significant Wave hegiht at Irvine and the bandpassed windspeed magnitude at the locations of interest

.m
A script to fit a 3D surface to the locations to extract a smooth lag surface across the computational domain
